Lab 3 of our Software Security course focuses on understanding and exploiting Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) vulnerabilities.
The objectives include grasping the concepts of ROP and creating a ROP gadget chain to overwrite the return address with the address of the function add_bin() and subsequently execute add_bash() and exec_string() to obtain a new shell.
Students will utilize the provided C code (lab3.c) containing a stack buffer overflow vulnerability and craft a Python script to execute the ROP attack.
The exploit should work outside of GDB, and students are required to provide a screenshot of the successful exploitation of the program as part of their deliverables.
