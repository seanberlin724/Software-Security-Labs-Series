# Software Security Labs Series: Comprehensive Exploitation Techniques
● Orchestrated a series of five labs and a final project focusing on stack buffer overflow, Return-Oriented
Programming (ROP), and kernel exploitation.
● Employed GDB debugger and assembly code analysis to dissect C programs, enhancing understanding of stack
frame manipulation, multi-stage exploits, and kernel vulnerabilities.
● Developed Python exploit scripts leveraging the pwntools library to demonstrate various exploitation methods,
such as Return Hijack Attacks, ROP chains, and Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerabilities.
● Executed payloads to overwrite return addresses, trigger target functions, and gain control over program
execution, ultimately retrieving sensitive information and gaining access to remote servers.
