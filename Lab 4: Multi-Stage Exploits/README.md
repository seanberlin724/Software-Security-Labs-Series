Lab 4 in our course dives deep into understanding and exploiting vulnerabilities using techniques such as Information Leakage, GOT Overwrite, and Return-Oriented Programming (ROP).
The main objective is to infiltrate a remote server and retrieve sensitive information by leveraging these methods.
Participants will gain hands-on experience in the intricacies of Multi-Stage Exploits, understanding the memory layout of running applications, manipulating Global Offset Table (GOT) entries,
and crafting ROP payloads to gain control over program execution.
The vulnerable program (lab4.c) running on the remote server (147.182.223.56:6666) provides an opportunity to practice these techniques, with the ultimate goal of retrieving the contents of flag.txt.
With ASLR/NX enabled and StackGuard/PIE disabled, participants will navigate the challenge of exploiting vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.
The libc version (libc6-i386 2.33-0ubuntu5 amd64) provides additional context for crafting effective exploits. Let the exploit begin!
