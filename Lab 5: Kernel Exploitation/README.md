Lab 5 focuses on understanding and exploiting kernel vulnerabilities, particularly the Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability in kernel space.
Utilizing QEMU, an open-source machine emulator and virtualizer, participants will launch the kernel exploitation process.
The lab entails booting up QEMU, tweaking the default file system by unpacking and repacking the rootfs.cpio file, compiling and executing kernel exploitation shellcode, and understanding the UAF vulnerability.
By following the provided steps and answering specific questions, participants gain practical insights into kernel exploitation techniques.
This hands-on approach enables a deeper understanding of kernel vulnerabilities and the mechanisms behind kernel exploitation.
