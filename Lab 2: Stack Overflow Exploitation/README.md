This lab, part of our Software Security course, focuses on understanding the fundamentals of stack overflows and learning how to exploit stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
Upon completion, students should articulate the nature of stack overflows, associated risks, and the methodology for exploiting such vulnerabilities.
The objective is to successfully execute an attack that exploits a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in a provided toy program.
The Return Hijack Attack task requires students to write an exploit script in Python using the pwntools library.
The script should output "hacked by [Your First + Last Name]!" when run on a Linux system by overwriting the return address with the address of the 'hacked()' function.
Steps include logging in to the Badger CTF platform, downloading the provided C code, modifying it according to student ID, compiling it, crafting the shellcode, and providing a detailed lab report
including screenshots demonstrating successful exploitation and explaining the method used to determine the Magic Numberâ€”the length of the dummy-character string required to overwrite the return address.
