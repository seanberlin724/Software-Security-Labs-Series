Lab 1: Stack and Assembly Analysis

This lab, a part of the Software Security course, delves into understanding stack and stack frames in C programming while leveraging GDB for reverse engineering and reading assembly code. Tasks include disassembling functions and analyzing assembly instructions, providing insights into software security concepts. Explore the creation of stack frames, variable assignments, and function calls to deepen understanding of low-level programming and security vulnerabilities.
